## Model Features

Common features across all implementations:
- Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom, etc.)
- Batch normalization
- Dropout for regularization
- Early stopping
- Learning rate scheduling
- Top-k accuracy metrics

## Web Interface

The Gradio web interface supports:
- Multiple model selection
- Top 3 predictions with confidence scores
- Easy-to-use image upload
- Real-time inference

## Dataset
The dataset contains images of plants with various conditions:
- Healthy plants
- Tobacco Strick disease
- Cercospora
